# The ultimate makefile I widh I had for C development

This makefile is simply the ultimate makefile I wish I had when I start developping in C.

These are the following features the makefile had:

 - Recompile when necessary (C files as well as header files)
 - Progress status when recompiling
 - Support multithread
